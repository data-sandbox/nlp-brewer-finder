    "## **04 Run NLP Model on Reviews**\n",
    "This notebook takes the processed reviews from an earlier notebook, runs the spacy NLP model on the text to determine brewery offerings, and generates a csv file containing the data needed for the streamlit app.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Notebook Objectives**\n",
    "1. Load the spacy NLP model previously trained following the project.yml file in the main directory\n",
    "2. Apply the model to all reviews to determine mentions of brewering offerings\n",
    "3. Group by brewery and sum all mentions of each brewery offering\n",
    "4. Merge grouped dataframe with another that contains location information (city, address, lat/lon, etc.) for streamlit app purposes\n",
    "5. Clean missing lat/lon info\n",
    "6. Export final dataframe as csv for use by streamlit app"
