They have some games and food vendors at these events. Good way to sample local food paired with Son's cocktails. I did a whiskey flight which allowed me to sample four whiskeys. All were good but Foolproof Porter was the favorite followed by Uprising. We also had American Pilsner which was very refreshing. Got to sample some local oysters too. Great time. Want to go for a tasting next time. Prices are very reasonable. \n"
